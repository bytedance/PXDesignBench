# Protenix Protein Design Evaluation Tools

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of tools for evaluating protein design tasks. It integrates multiple state-of-the-art models and offers scripts to assess various aspects of protein design. 

The codebase is organized into three main components:

- `metrics`: Scripts to evaluate different aspects of protein design, such as sequence quality, structure quality, and designability.

- `tasks`: Pipelines for running specific protein design tasks, including monomer and binder design.

- `tools`: Wrappers for external models such as Protenix, ProteinMPNN, AlphaFold2 and ESMFold to streamline evaluations.

Current supported tasks and tools are:
| **Task**   | **Sequence Generation** | **Structure Consistency**             |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Monomer**| ProteinMPNN             | ðŸ”¹ ESMFold                            |
| **Binder** | ProteinMPNN             | ðŸ”¹ AlphaFold2 <br> ðŸ”¹ Protenix         |


## Dependencies

1. **Install Protenix** â€“ a high-accuracy structure prediction tool:  
   [Protenix Installation Guide](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation)

2. **Install additional dependencies** for ProteinMPNN, AlphaFold2, and ESMFold:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign.git --no-deps  # tested with colabdesign-1.1.3
pip install "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
pip install transformers==4.51.3
```

3. **Download model weights**
- **ESMFold:** [Download](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esmfold_v1/tree/main)  
- **AlphaFold2:** [Download](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold?tab=readme-ov-file#model-parameters)  
- **ProteinMPNN:**  
  - [CA model weights](https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN/tree/main/ca_model_weights)  
  - [Soluble model weights](https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN/tree/main/soluble_model_weights)  
  - [Vanilla model weights](https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN/tree/main/vanilla_model_weights)

The default paths for model weights are defined in **`eval_design/globals.py`**.  
After downloading the required weights for ESMFold, AlphaFold2, and ProteinMPNN, please update the corresponding variables in `globals.py` to match your local directory structure.
